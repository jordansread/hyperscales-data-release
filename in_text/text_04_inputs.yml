  Process-based water temperature predictions: 4 Model inputs (meteorological inputs and ice flags)

abstract: >-
  This dataset includes model inputs (specifically, weather and flags for predicted ice-cover) and is part of a larger data release of lake temperature model inputs and outputs for 7,150 lakes in the U.S.
  states of Minnesota and Wisconsin (http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/P9CA6XP8).

          These ice cover estimates were obtained by running GLM (Hipsey et al. 2019) and saving outputs at
          daily resolution (nsave = 1) and using the glmtools R package (also described in Hipsey et al. 2019) to
          extract hourly radiation just below the surface as simulated by the model (command was
          glmtools::get_var(nc_daily, var_name = 'hice')), and exporting a value of "TRUE" if hice was greater than zero.
