  Process-based water temperature predictions in the Midwest US: 5 Model prediction data

abstract: >-
  Multiple modeling frameworks were used to predict daily temperatures at 0.5m depth intervals for a set of diverse lakes in the U.S.
  states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. General Lake Model verion 2 process-Based (PB) models were configured and calibrated with training data to reduce root-mean squared error for 449 lakes (PBALL).
  Uncalibrated models used default configurations (PB0; see Winslow et al. 2016 for details) and no parameters were adjusted according to model fit with observations for 7,150 lakes.

      A zip file containing a csv file for every lake within {group_id} for Process-Based uncalibrated
      model output (PB0) and calibrated model output (PBALL) temperature data. Files within the zip are 
      named "pb0_{site_id}_temperatures.csv" for uncalibrated temperature data and "pball_{site_id}_temperatures.csv" 
      for calibrated temperature data, where `site_id` is the lake nhdhr id.

      An image map of the lakes that have temperature predictions for either model on top
      of a map of the U.S. Midwest with state and county boundaries. There are also multi-colored
      rectangles with numeric values from 1 to 35 overlaid on the map, which correspond to the 
      group number used in the filenames for the `predictions_*.zip` files to help users locate 
      data if they are interested in a specific area.

build-environment: >-
  For PBALL and PB0 predictions we used USGS Advanced Research Computing, USGS Yeti Supercomputer (https://doi.org/10.5066/F7D798MJ); process-based predictions were generated with the following open source tools available in the R programming language (R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23)).\n
  The computing platform for generating data and metadata was x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu. R packages loaded into this environment: dplyr, version: 0.8.1; glmtools, version: 0.15.0; rLakeAnalyzer, version: 1.11.4; GLMr, version: 3.1.14; readr, version: 1.3.1;
