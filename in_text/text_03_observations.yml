  Process-based water temperature predictions: 3 Temperature observations

abstract: >-
  Observed water temperatures from 1980-2019 were compiled for 5,584 lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin (USA). A subset of these data were used
  as calibration for process-based models on some lakes (see "pball" models).
  The data are formatted as a single csv (comma separated values) file with attributes corresponding to the unique combination of
  lake identifier, time, and depth. Data came from a variety of sources, including the Water Quality Portal,
  the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research Project, and digitized temperature
  records from the MN Department of Natural Resources. Upper and Lower Red Lake data were filtered out of this release.
