  Data release: Process-guided deep learning predictions of lake water temperature

abstract: >-
  <p>Climate change has been shown to influence lake temperatures in different ways. To better understand the diversity of lake responses to climate change and give managers tools to manage individual lakes,
  we focused on improving prediction accuracy for daily water temperature profiles in 12,XXX lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin during 1980-2018.
  <br/>The data are organized into these items:</p><ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5db8194be4b0b0c58b5a4c3c">Spatial data</a> - One shapefile of polygons for all 12,XXX lakes in this study (.shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5db81967e4b0b0c58b5a4c3f">Model configurations</a> - Model parameters and metadata used to configure models (1 JSON file, with metadata for each of 12,XXX lakes, indexed by "site_id")</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5db81985e4b0b0c58b5a4c41">Temperature observations</a> - Data formatted as model inputs for training, calibrating, or evaluating temperature models</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5db81996e4b0b0c58b5a4c43">Model inputs</a> - Data used to drive predictive models</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5db819a8e4b0b0c58b5a4c45">Prediction data</a> - Predictions from PGDL and calibrated and uncalibrated PB models</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5db819bbe4b0b0c58b5a4c47">Predicted habitat</a> - Data formated for ecological use</li>
